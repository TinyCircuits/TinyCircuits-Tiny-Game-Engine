            WARNING: It is not recommended to save files to Thumby Color. Make sure everything is saved to a computer, opened in Thonny, and then the green run/play button (explained later) is used to upload and run the script. Assets need to be saved/uploaded to the device, make sure those are also backed up on a computer.
            <br>
            NOTE: Need to do <code>import engine_main</code> before anything else to start engine and consistently reset it
            <br>
            NOTE: The engine is still under development and the API may change in some spots, we'll try to help convert any code in the future.
            <br>
            NOTE: <b>Physics</b> and <b>Audio</b> are still under development and partially function. The API and functionality still need worked on.
        </p>


        <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
            <pr>The Thonny IDE can be used to upload files and run scripts, it can be downloaded from <a href="https://thonny.org/">here</a>.

            <h4>Setting up Thonny:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Plug Thumby Color in and flip switch to on (to the right when looking at the screen)
                <li>In the bottom-right of Thonny, click the `no backend` or `Local Python 3` text
                <li>Select `MicroPython (generic) * Board CDC COMXX` (may need to press the red stop sign in the top-left)
            </ol>

            <h4>Uploading an asset/file using Thonny:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Plug Thumby Color in
                <li>Turn it ON
                <li>Press the red stop sign button in Thonny
                <li>Wait for the Thonny shell to print something like "Type "help()" for more information"
                <li>In the top-left `Files` panel navigate to the folder containing your files/assets you want to upload
                <li>Right-click the file/asset and left-click "Upload to /"
            </ol>
            Now your file should be on the device.

            <h4>Running a script using Thonny:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Plug Thumby Color in
                <li>Turn it ON
                <li>Press the red stop sign button in Thonny
                <li>Type code into the Thonny editor or open a Python file
                <li>Press the green play/run button in the top, the script should start running.
            </ol>

            <h4>Common errors:</h4>
            <ul>
                <li>If an exception occurs at the line where <code>engine.start()</code> is, that probably means something in the engine tried to cast some type of data to another type that is not supported. Let Jason know
            </ul>

        <h3>Examples:</h3>

        <h4>Example #1: Hello World!</c></h4>
        <pre>
import engine_main

import engine
import engine_draw
from engine_nodes import Rectangle2DNode, CameraNode

# By default, nodes are at center of screen at 0,0
rectangle = Rectangle2DNode(width=25, height=25, color=engine_draw.red)

# Make a camera to render the scene
camera = CameraNode()

# Start rendering the scene
engine.start()
</pre>


        <h4>Example #2: Using node callbacks</h4>
        <pre>
import engine_main

import engine
import engine_draw
import engine_io
from engine_nodes import Sprite2DNode, CameraNode
from engine_resources import TextureResource

# Set the FPS limit so that game code doesn't run too fast
engine.set_fps_limit(60)

# All BMPs need to be saved in RGB565 16-bit (no alpha)
background_texture = TextureResource("background.bmp")
player_texture = TextureResource("player.bmp")

# Set a static background. Zoom and scaling will not apply to it,
# use a sprite for that. Backgrounds are required to be 128x128px
engine_draw.set_background(background_texture)

# Create a `Player` class that inherits from `Sprite2DNode`
class Player(Sprite2DNode):
    def __init__(self):
        # Required, links the parent class to this one we're creating
        super().__init__(self)
        self.texture = player_texture
        self.frame_count_x = 2
        self.frame_count_y = 2
        self.fps = 5
        self.playing = True
        self.transparent_color = engine_draw.black

    # Define a callback that the engine will invoke every game tick
    def tick(self, dt):
        # NOTE: Game coordinate system is -y = to top of screen, +y = to bottom of screen
        if engine_io.check_pressed(engine_io.DPAD_UP):
            self.position.y -= 1
        elif engine_io.check_pressed(engine_io.DPAD_DOWN):
            self.position.y += 1

        # X axis works how it should
        if engine_io.check_pressed(engine_io.DPAD_LEFT):
            self.position.x -= 1
        elif engine_io.check_pressed(engine_io.DPAD_RIGHT):
            self.position.x += 1

# Make an instance of our class
player = Player()

# Make a camera to render the scene
camera = CameraNode()

# Start rendering the scene
engine.start()

        <h3>Launcher Folder Structure:</h3>
        Games have to be in subdirectories of <code>/Games</code>. They can be organised in any directory structure.

        <h4>Minimal example:</h4>
            <pre>
─ /Games/mygame
  ├─ main.py
</pre>
            This type of format will show up with a question mark as the icon and the folder name as the game name.

        <h4>Minimal example with icon:</h4>
            <pre>
─ /Games/mygame
  ├─ main.py
  ├─ icon.bmp
</pre>
            Instead of a question mark, the game will show up with <code>icon.bmp</code> as the icon. For now, the only supported resolution is 64x64.

        <h4>Full example:</h4>
            <pre>
─ /Games/mygame
  ├─ manifest.ini
  ├─ game.py
  ├─ game_icon.bmp
</pre>
            In this example, the names of all the assets are configured in <code>manifest.ini</code>. In the manifest the following lines can be present:
            <pre>
name = Any Name I Want
version = 0.3
main = game.py
icon = game_icon.bmp
</pre>
            This format is recommended, and at least the version entry should appear in the manifest. The other entries are optional, defaulting
            to directory name, main.py and icon.bmp.
