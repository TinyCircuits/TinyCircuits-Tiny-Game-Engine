            NOTE: The engine is still under development and the API may change in some spots, we'll try to help convert any code in the future.

            NOTE: <b>Physics</b> and <b>Audio</b> are still under development and partially function. The API and functionality still need worked on.

        <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
        <h>
            The Thonny IDE can be used to upload files and run scripts, it can be downloaded from <a href="https://thonny.org/">here</a>.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Uploading an asset/file using Thonny:</b>
            <br>1. Plug Thumby Color in
            <br>2. If it's ON, toggle it OFF and then back ON
            <br>3. Press the red stop sign button in Thonny
            <br>4. Wait for the Thonny shell to print something like "Type "help()" for more information"
            <br>5. In the top-left `Files` panel navigate to the folder containing your files/assets you want to upload
            <br>6. Right-click the file/asset and left-click "Upload to /"
            <br>
            Now your file should be on the device.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Running a script using Thonny:</b>
            <br>1. Plug Thumby Color in
            <br>2. If it's ON, toggle it OFF and then back ON
            <br>3. Press the red stop sign button in Thonny
            <br>4. Type code into the Thonny editor or open a Python file
            <br>5. Press the green play/run button in the top, the script should start running.
            <br>
            <br>
            <b>Common errors:</b>
            <br>* Pressing the green `run` button twice will not work currently. Toggle the power off and back on each time (working on fixing this)
            <br>* If an exception occurs at the line where `engine.start()` is, that probably means something in the engine tried to cast some type of data to another type that is not supported. Let Jason know
