I'm not much of a Windows dev, so the Visual Studio project is sometimes not up to date.
If there is anything wrong, pull requests are highly appreciated!

As of June 2015 I've dropped support for pre-2015 versions. In the past, everybody had their favorite version,
and they all needed separate projects, but this was a huge pain to handle. I recently rewrote the demos to use
Sokol, a even more lightweight replacement for GLFW so I didn't need to bundle GLFW binaries. I decided it was
a good time to cutoff support for older versions.

If you were still using one of the older projects feel free to update it and send me a pull request.
